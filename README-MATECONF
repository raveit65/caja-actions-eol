Deprecating MateConf
=================

 Mate is deprecating MateConf in favour of GSettings. This is the short story.
 We so have to migrate several pool of datas.
 
 Starting with 3.1.0, Caja-Actions is distributed with the needed migration
 tools, whether the migration may occur automatically (for users items and
 preferences), or the system admin must run a script (for mandatory items).
 
 Note that this does not break backward compatibility. The 3.1.x serie of
 Caja-Actions may still be run on a "old" platform. The oldest supported
 as of January 2011 is Ubuntu 8 LTS.

 1. Items, menus and actions, stored in MateConf backend
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Historically, actions, then menus, were stored in MateConf. These are user items.

 A system admin was free to define mandatory menus and actions, and to store
 them in the Mandatory pool of MateConf. Such defined items are so available to
 all users, though as read-only items.

   1a. Migrating user items
   ------------------------
   The good news is:
   user items are automatically migrated from MateConf to .desktop files.

   The migration happens when the user runs the Caja-Actions Configuration
   Tool user interface, or when the Caja-Actions menu plugin is loaded
   by the Caja file-manager, or when the user runs one of the command-line
   tools caja-actions-new or caja-actions-run.

   The caja-actions-print command-line tool, along with na-delete-xmltree,
   and na-print-schemas installed in PKGLIBEXECDIR, have no effect on the
   migration process.

   The new .desktop files are stored in HOME/.local/file-manager/actions.

   When the migration of its items has occurred, the MateConf I/O Provider is
   disabled, both for reading and writing.

   1b. Migrating mandatory items
   -----------------------------
   The bad news is:
   the system admin has to manually run PKGLIBEXECDIR/na-mateconf2key.sh script
   as root in order to migrate existing mandatory items to .desktop files.

   The new .desktop files default to be stored in /usr/share/file-manager/actions.

   It is enough to run this script once, e.g. when installing for the first time
   a recent enough version (>= 3.1.0) of Caja-Actions.
   
   Command-line example:
   # /usr/libexec/caja-actions/na-mateconf2key.sh -delete -nodummy

 2. User preferences stored in MateConf
 -----------------------------------
 Mandatory and user preferences follow the same migration rules that items:

 - user preferences are automatically migrated,
 - mandatory preferences have to be manually migrated by the system admin.
 
 Preferences are renamed and reorganized:

 User preferences for I/O providers were stored as /apps/caja-actions/io-providers/<provider_id>
 keys. They are moved to [io-provider <provider_id>] group.

 MateConf                                                 Key
 -----------------------------------------             --------------------------------------

 writable                                              writable

 3. Sysadmin reserved mandatory keys
 -----------------------------------
 These were
   /apps/caja-actions/mandatory/
     all/locked
     na-desktop/locked
     na-mateconf/locked

 These keys are just ignored if they are not in the mandatory MateConf pool, i.e.
 if they happens to be eventually editable by the user.

 If these keys are actually in the system mandatory MateConf pool, they are renamed
 in the following way:

 MateConf                                      Group      Key
 -----------------------------------------  ------     --------------------------------------

                                            [nact]     preferences-locked
                                            [runtime]  io-providers-locked

 /apps/caja-actions/mandatory/na-desktop/locked    <removed>
 /apps/caja-actions/mandatory/na-mateconf/locked      <removed>
