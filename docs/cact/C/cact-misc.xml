          The new action is also displayed in red color in the items list.
          Red color is used as an indicator that the item
          is invalid, that is that the item cannot be candidate to be displayed in a
          &caja; context menu because some of its informations are missing or erroneous.
          Here, and though this newly inserted action has some suitable defaults, it lacks a 
          command to be executed to be considered valid by &appname;
        </para>
