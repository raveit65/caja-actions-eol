    <para>
      Deletion applies to current selection.

    <para>
      Be warned that selecting and deleting all profiles of an action
      leaves it without any profile, so in an invalid state.
      The name of the action will be written in red (because it is
      invalid) and italic (because it has been modified) characters.

  <sect3 id="usage-edit-multiple">
    <title>Multiple selection</title>
    <para>
      Multiple selection is possible in <application>Caja-Actions Configuration Tool</application>.
      You can extend the current selection
      <!-- i18n: "Ctrl" and "Shit" are key names -->
      by pressing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> or <keycap>Shift</keycap>
      while selecting an item to add to the selection.
    </para>
    <para>
      <application>Caja-Actions Configuration Tool</application> only accepts homogeneous multiple selections. That is, you may
      select one or more profiles, or one or more actions or menus. A multiple
      selection containing both profiles and actions or menus is not allowed.
      This is because <application>Caja-Actions Configuration Tool</application> would not know where to paste such a selection.
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that selecting any row means also selecting children of this row.
      These children are said &#171;&#160;implicitely selected&#160;&#187;:
      they will be part of next edition operations, but are not considered
      when verifying if selection is homogeneous.
      Also, they cannot be explicitely selected (nor unselected).
